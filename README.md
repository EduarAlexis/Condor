**Pokémon consuming app**
Create a simple app that consumes the service to get all pokémon’s information provided by the
PokéAPI: https://pokeapi.co/. It must contain the following features:

* Have a way to show all pokémon in order and separated by generation 1, 2, 3 & 4.
* When a pokémon is tapped, the app should display another view that contains the following
info:
a. Official-Artwork
b. Name
c. Types (water, fire, poison, etc)
d. Pokedex number.
e. Weight & Height
f. List of at least 5 moves (scratch, sand-attack, headbutt, etc)
g. Optional: Another info you consider ok.

* There should be another view for voting random pokémons using the ‘Like’ or ‘Dislike’ way.
* Store into a local database each voted pokémon. The app should be able to show that list.
Considerations
* The app should run on iOS 13.0 and above.
* Manage error cases properly.
* Use any architectural pattern different from MVC (MVP, MVVM, VIPER, Clean).
* Use Swift only.
* Add Unit & UI tests as much as possible.
* You can use any framework/library that you consider convenient.
